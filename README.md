## APPLICATION IN USE

## INSTALLATION

I began this process by creating my server.js and connection.js files to build a boilerplate foundation to build my models and controllers off of. The next step was to create my models for Users, Reactions, and Thoughts based on the parameters set in the assignments acceptance criteria. The next step was to create my routes files and build basic get requests to test the functionality of the application and check for errors.
